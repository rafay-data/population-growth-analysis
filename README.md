# 📊 Population Growth Simulation with UN Data

This project simulates population growth using real-world data from the United Nations. It combines mathematical modeling with data analysis to visualize how populations grow over time, incorporating both logistic growth and real data trends.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

- To understand and simulate population growth using logistic growth models.
- To compare simulated results with actual data.
- To visualize population trends over time for better insights.

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

**`population.csv`**  
Includes actual population figures for multiple countries/regions, based on UN records.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📈 Logistic growth model using NumPy
- 📊 Data visualization using Matplotlib
- 🧪 Real-world dataset analysis
- 🔁 Comparison between actual and simulated growth

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
